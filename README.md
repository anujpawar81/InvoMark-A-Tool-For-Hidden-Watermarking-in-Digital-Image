# InvoMark-A-Tool-For-Hidden-Watermarking-in-Digital-Image
The process of embedding a hidden watermark in an image is widely used for various purposes such as copyright protection, authentication, and security. In this project, we propose a technique for implementing hidden watermarking on an image using Python. 
The proposedtechnique involves converting the image into an array of pixels, generating a watermark,
applying a transform to the watermark, embedding the watermark into the original image by
modifying the pixel values, and saving the watermarked image to a file.
